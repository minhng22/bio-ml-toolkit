    "content": "Cellular senescence is characterized by a permanent state of cell cycle arrest accompanied by a secretory phenotype. Research has shown that senescent cells accumulate with age and contribute to age-related pathologies. Senolytics are a class of drugs designed to selectively eliminate senescent cells, potentially alleviating age-related conditions.",

This framework has been instrumental in organizing research on aging mechanisms and potential interventions.",
